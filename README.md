# WinCCOAServiceController
If multiple projects need to be run on the same machine, different services need to be created&started.Normally WinCCOA does not allow to run multiple project on one machine, but you still can if you change default ports and register every project on the different called windows service.

This program allows you to start and stop those services. Allows also to run some external commands (launch GUI or GEDI for example).
